After seeing LIverpool and Manchester City part with a boring 0:0 draw the night before at Vavel Coffee in Kissamos I was ready to hit the beautiful beaches of this region. On the way there I stopped in a woodworks shop in Topolia village and had coffee with the owner who is quite a character. I headed 1st to the famous Elafonsini beach, but seeing the hoards of cars going there I opted for the quieter more secluded magnificent beach of Kedrodasos where you can find a small bay or rock or dune to practice naturism.

##### Worth mentioning  are:


* Workshop Tsouris, Topolia - A large variety of woodworks on display and a lovely chap running it
* Moni Chrisoskalitissis - A nice Monastery by the sea with beautiful views of the bay
