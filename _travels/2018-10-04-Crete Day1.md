### Driving from Herkalion to Skaloti and finding out about greek coffee and salad

There are many great things about Crete but generally speaking food is not one of them.
I have eaten much better Greek Salads than any I had here, not to mention the coffee that is a very weak version of the turkish coffee I am used to.
Notwithstanding, there are several very good restaurants which I will mention.
As for hospitality and good vibes, many places along the way, Restaurants and cafes are just beautiful relaxing places with charming hosts.
