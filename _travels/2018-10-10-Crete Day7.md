For some reason the map legend won’t come up on this day but it was pretty similar to Day 6, driving wise. Since the day was cloudy I decided to explore Chania a little more outside the old city. I have been to a lively cafe by name of ‘Kross coffee roasters’ and strolled thru Chania’s less touristic streets. Later on I dined again at the excellent Irene Tavern and visited the Kalathas beach. For some reason this area is very appealing to people coming from out of Greece and there are many projects building houses for ex-pats.
