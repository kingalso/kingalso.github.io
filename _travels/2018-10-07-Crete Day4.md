On my fourth day I moved from Skaloti in the south to Kissamos in the north west. Driving thru Crete is really a driver’s heaven, the roads are challenging and scenic. In fact along the roads you will see many memorial statues for people killed in accidents, so be careful. If you fancy short hikes like I do, there’s a really nice 45 minutes trail going up to Kalamato Cave near the village of Vafes (point C on the map).

##### Worth mentioning  are:


* Doinas Tavern in Drakonas Village - The best food I tasted in Crete. If you’re going in the weekend beware it is a favorite local spot and might be packed with people.
* The Drive thru the Theriso gorge (E towards F) is absolutely magnificent.
