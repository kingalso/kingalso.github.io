Crete is all about beaches, and the smaller they are, or the harder it is to arrive there the better. Don’t go for the famous beaches with tens or hundreds of people, go for those with 10 persons or less. They are everywhere, a stretch of 10-50 meters, a tavern perhaps, a dock, one boat, 3 parasols, 5 people on the sand 3 in the water, and half a mile further it repeats itself, maybe this time there are rooms as well. Also if you want to go the full monty, FKK, the way you’re intended to, there are many options in Crete and the best thing you can do is consult [the excellent captain barefoot website](http://www.capnbarefoot.info/crete).

##### Worth mentioning  are:


* Platanos Taverna in Anopoli - Excellent Food in an excellent setting
* Phoenix Beach - It is quite a drive in dirt roads (True to Oct 2018)
